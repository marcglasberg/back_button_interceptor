## [4.3.1] - 2020/09/14

* Docs improvement.

## [4.3.0] - 2020/06/22
 
* Breaking change: The interceptor functions now get a second 
  parameter `RouteInfo info`. To upgrade from version [4.2.4] 
  you just need to add this parameter to your functions (you 
  have to add it, but you don't need to use it, unless you 
  need the new functionalities it provides).
  
* Please read the "Notes" section of the README for more information
  about the new `RouteInfo` parameter.
